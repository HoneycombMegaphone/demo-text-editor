# demo-text-editor

A simplistic text editor written in C as a learning project. Plans TBD

Decisions / Features of planned text editor:

Syntax highlighting system based on Regex
    - Intended coverage for a hanful of languages TBD. Initial coverage for C
    - General highlighting syntax for note taking / general purpose, possibly with markdown

Command Line Interface
    - Likely will default to modal system
    - Possibility for unique / more user friendly options to utilize both modes?

Spell Checking functionality
    - Default to ASCII encoding
    - Morse Code may be fun to have
    - UTF-8 / UTF-16?

Organizational Features
    - Auto indentation and indentation correction
    - Auto correction, limited to available variables & functions?
    - Auto completion in similar vein as auto correct
    - Brace matching and automatic usage dependent on which used? (parentheses, brackets, & braces)

Way to Jump between functions / Function List
    - Would work well with default idea of having a general purpose usage of editor
    - Need to weigh the benefits of having a tab or new window for reasons like this
